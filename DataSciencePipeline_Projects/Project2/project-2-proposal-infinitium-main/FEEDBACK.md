1. Only 2.5 RQs defined.
2. How to measure the _influence_ of abortion and the vote?

# NOTES FROM 1:1

1. Maybe look for correlations between sentiment (or something) of abortion between (D) and (R) leaning users. take a look at tool mentioned in https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/download/18110/17913/21605
2. Make sure you spend time figuring out which libraries for analysis etc. you are going to use.
