1. Overall one of the top reports.
2. Writing very good, etc.
3. Details on how much data has actually been collected up until report (update on the napkin math; are you going to have enough storage?)
4. Static list of YouTube videos
5. How exactly is the continuous data collecton working?
6. How is it running continuously?

# NOTES FROM 1:1

1. Think collecting for YouTube links that show up in Twitter or Reddit.
2. Right now, hand running. We need to figure out a way to deal with this.
3. Systematic way to increase the set of hashtags is via "snowball sampling" of co-occuring hashtags. check https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.06877.pdf maybe.

Uncurved report: 97

Implementation: 85
Get continuous collection working --> +5
