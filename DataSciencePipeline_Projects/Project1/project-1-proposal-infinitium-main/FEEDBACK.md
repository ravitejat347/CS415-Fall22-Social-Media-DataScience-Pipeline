* Make sure that docs are in the write format.
* How will positive sentiment be classed? pro government or anti govbernment stance on abortion?
* Which tool to use sentiment analysis?
* No 3rd party librarires to collect data. E.g., no PRAW! You need to collect data from twitter and reddit directly.

# NOTES FROM 1:1

* We are verifying if Google API client can be used for YouTube.
* Make sure you are using the Twitter 1% streaming API. Not keywords searches or anything.
* Make sure you check reddit's directly accessible APIs. Maybe start from https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/
